Recap
    Overloading:
        It is a mechanism that allows us to have methods with the same name but with different
        number of parameters, different type of parameters or with different sequence of parameters

        void hello(){
        }

        void hello(String name){
        //overloading by changing the number of parameters
        }

        void hello(char[] name){
        //overloading by changing the datatype of parameters
        }
        void hello(char[] name, String address){

        }
        void hello(String address, char[] name){
        //overloading by changing the sequence of parameters
        }

       1- Rules we can overload methods in the same class
       2- Name of the method should be same
       3- cannot overload a method by changing return type
       4- if we have an overloaded method Java will perform widening automatically when called
       but it will not automatically do narrowing

       void add(int a, int b){}
       add(10,10) but not add(10.5,10.5) CE error

        void add(double a, double b){}
        add(10,10) and add(10.5,10.5) will have no issues

        * If we are not sure about the number of arguments we can use var args to pass any number of parameters

        aa(int ... numbers){

        for(int number: numbers){
        System.out.print(number)
        }
        }

        * Access modifiers do not accept the method overloading in the same class
        *We can overload the static method and the main method by following the
        overloading rules

Overriding:
    When same method with same return type(this will matter***) and same signature exists in two classes
    which have inheritance relationship

    When we have same methods in the parent child classes with static modifier we say that we are hiding
    a method by re-declaring it instead of overriding a method

    Main method cannot be overridden.
