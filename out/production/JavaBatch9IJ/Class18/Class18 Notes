Types of variables:
1) Local Variables
    Any variable declared inside a method, constructor or any block of code like if
    conditions loops and switches are called local variables

    Advantages:
        Memory Efficient
    Disadvantages:
        Very low accessibility


2) Instance Variables
    Variables declared inside a class and outside of any method constructor or
    block of code are called instance variables

    Advantages:
        Can be accessed in all methods which are not static
        Can be accessed by creating objects inside the static methods or in any other class
    Disadvantages:
        If not used properly it can waste a lot of unnecessary memory


3)Static Variables
    An instance variable declared with static keyword is called a static variable

    Advantages:
        Shared across all the instances of the class

Access Modifiers:
Help access control the access to class properties/attributes and methods/behaviours
There are for types of access modifiers
private:
    can only be accessed within the same class
default:
    Can only be accessed within the same package
protected:
    Can be accessed inside the child classes
public:
    If we write public keyword before any property or method that means it
    can be accessed anywhere in our project

Method Declaration
    Access Modifiers (optional)
    return type (not optional)
    name of method (not optional)
    () parameters are optional but parenthesis are not optional
    {} (not optional)

 Note:
    Always try to make your properties private and then define methods to
    change those properties, that way we will have more control over the
    properties.
