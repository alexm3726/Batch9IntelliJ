Recap:
    Variables and arrays are not flexible to solve common life problems
    to overcome this we have Collections framework but collection framework can't be used
    with primitive types it only support object types

    Wrapper Classes:
        -Object equivalent of primitive data types that can be used with collections framework and have built-in methods
        to convert one datatype to other.
        1)ArrayList:
            -Insertion order is maintained
            -ArrayLists can contain duplicate values
            -we can access the elements using the indexes by using the get method
            - If we are using collections framework to access the data most of the time we should be using arraysList
            because arraysLists use arrays under the hood the read access is very fast with arrays
            -if we require to insert the data in front or in the middle of the of the arrayList then we should
            not be using arrayList because when an item is inserted in between or in the start all the elements in the
            arraysList are shifted towards right (can be very very slow if data is huge)
            -Because the arrayLists can modify its size at run time it can be problematic to use loops to
            perform the add and remove operation to overcome this we have Iterators in java
