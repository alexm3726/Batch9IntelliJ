Collections Framework:

1) Arraylist
2) LinkedList
3) HashSet
4) LinkedHashSet
5) TreeSet
==========================
ArrayList:
    It is a data structure that stores the element based on index
    1. It can hold duplicate values
    2. It maintains the insertion order
    3. Dynamic in nature(Can adjust the time at runtime)
    4. Underlying data structure are arrays
When to use:
    1. When we do not know the size (Will be better if we have an idea of the size we will be dealing with)
    2. Fast retrieval based on index

LinkedList:
    1. Can hold duplicate values
    2. It maintains insertion order
    3. Dynamic in nature(Can adjust the time at runtime)
    4. Underlying data structure are doubly linked list
When to use:
    1. When we are not sure about the size
    2. When we have to modify the data most of the tiime we should be using LinkedList

HashSet
    1. No duplicates
    2. Allows null
    3. No Order
    4. The underlying data structure is a Hash
When to use
    1. When we have to remove the duplicates from the data (We don't care about the order)
    2.

LinkedHashSet
    1. No duplicates
    2. Allows null
    3. Insertion order is maintained
    4. The underlying data structure is a Hash
When to use
    1. When we have to remove the duplicates from the data and we don't want to remove the duplicates
    2.

TreeSet
    1. No duplicates
    2. does not allow null values
    3. data is sorted in a natural order (if letters then alphabetical, if numbers from small to large)
When to use
    1. When we have to remove the duplicates from the data
    2.

Maps
    Map is interface that helps us store the data in the form of key value pairs
