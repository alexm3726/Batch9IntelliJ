Recap:

Access modifiers:
    Keywords that control the access to class members( properties, methods, constructors,
    inner classes, and interfaces)

    private-
        can only be accessed in the same class.
    protected-
        when we inherit from one class only available to the child
    default(not a keyword)-
        automatic behavior if nothing is specified. Can be accessed in the same class and
        the same package
    public-
        Available to the entire project.
==================================================================================================

Constructor:
    It is a special block of code that helps us initialize the fields, properties, or variables of a class.

    class ABC{
    ABC(){
    }
    }

    Constructor declarations are very similar to methods' but without return types

    Name fo the construct should be same as of our class.

===============================================================================================

-If we are in a separate class or if we are inside a static method in the same class
    we need an object of the class if we want to access the instance members (fields, methods)
-When we are declaring something the sequence does not matter
    The sequence matters when we are calling something

Constructor rules
    -Same name as class name
    -no return type(not even void)
    -executes automatically during creating object
