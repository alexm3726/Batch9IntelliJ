String is a class in java that helps us manipulate combination of letters
There are many useful methods to manipulate these combination of letters
For example:
isEmpty()=> checks if a string object contains any letters or not
length()
toUpperCase()
toLowerCase()
substring()
Internal memory implementation of the string class
Strings are immutable which means once a String object is created inside the computer
memory we cannot change the value of that object
If we try to change the value of String object a new object will be created and
changes will be made to that new object
But if we use the StringBuilder class no objects for the duplicate values will be scanned from
the memory and always a new object will be created inside the memory

When should we use String and StringBuilder?

if we know that most of our variables will contain same values and memory consumption (and speed doesn't matter)
is important then we should use String class. It saves a lot of memory but it can be slow because everytime we create
a variable all of the existing String objects will be scanned.

If speed is important and memory is not and if String objects contain different values
then use StringBuilder

Types of Variables with respect to their scope.

    In Java there are three types of variables
    1)Local Variables
    2)Instance Variables
    3)Static Variables

Local Variable:
    The variables which are declared inside a method, constructor or any block of code like if conditions,
    while loops, for loops, do while loops, switch statement
    or anything inside a class that has a "{" and an ending "}"
    or inside the parentheses like "(" and ")"

    When to use local variable:
        Always use local variables if it is possible.
        They are very memory efficient
        They are destroyed as soon as we are done executing the method,
        but instance variables will stay in memory as long as the object is in use

For example:
void print(){
String name="blablablabla"; //local variable
}

Instance Variables:
    The variables which are declared inside a class but outside of a method, constructor or any block of code like
    if conditions, while loops, for loops, do while loops, switch statement
    or anything inside a class that has a "{" and an ending "}"
    or inside the parentheses like "(" and ")"
    instance variables can be accessed anywhere inside a class by directly calling them using their names
    but we can not access them inside a static method (will explain later) by directly calling their names
    but we can access them by creating an object of that class

Static Variables:
    Any instance variable declared with a static keyword is called a static variable;
