Recap

    Overriding:
        It is when a=we have the same methods in parent and child classes.
        *There should be a a parent child relationship between the classes. (inheritance)
        *The return type and parameters of methods should be the same
        *We cannot override private methods/ constructor because they don't participate
        in inheritance
        *We can not decrease the visibility of a method being overwritten but we can increase
        *Static methods cannot be overridden but can be re-declared thus hiding the parent
        static method and it will behave the same as overridden
