Final Keyword:

    Final keyword in Java is used to show that something is complete and doesn't need any modification
        *We can use the Final keyword with variables to indicate that the value of this variable is final
        *We can use it with method to show that method implementation is final and it cannot be overridden
        by child classes
        *with classes so that no class can inherit from that class

    Final with variables
        *Always try to make your variables as final is possible(helps reduce bugs)
        *widely used with static keyword
