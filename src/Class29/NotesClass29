Variables
    -They hold data
    1) one value at a time if we need to store more data we will have to declare
    that many variables---> not feasible.
Arrays
    -Consecutive memory locations pointed by a single variable
    1) Fixed in size once the array is declared we cannot change the size
    2) If we declare a bigger array at the start we may be wasting memory
    3) if we declare a smaller array we have to do a lot of work to accommodate
    entries beyond the size of the array

To Rescue we have Collections framework in java

Collections Framework
    -is a collection of classes and interfaces that can hold objects as a single unit
    like arrays, but with a lot of flexibility.

    -Pros
        1) Less code built-in methods to solve common problems that we may face
        2) no Fixed sizes all the classes in collections framework are flexible
        we don't need to declare the size upfront
        3)memory efficient

    -Cons:

        1) We cannot use primitive data types in collections framework, but to overcome this issue
        we have wrapper classes.

Wrapper Classes
    Wrapper Classes are just objects equivalent of primitive types
    for all the primitive types we have wrapper classes
    we can use them in collections framework
