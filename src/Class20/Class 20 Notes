Recap:

Constructor:
    -Special block of code that helps us initialize the instance fields/properties/ variables/methods
    -It is called automatically when we create an object of the class
    -While defining Constructors we do not mention the return type not even void name
    -Name of the constructor should be same as name of the class.

this:
    keyword used to show java we want to use current instance method or variable.

this():
    keyword with parenthesis to call the current class constructor
    we use this to avoid code repetition.
===================================================================

Inheritance:
    A mechanism/ process that we can use to inherit properties and
    methods from another class to avoid code duplication.
